## From Entrepreneurial Thinking to Market Relevance - How Startups Scale

This is a very interesting class that I took this semester. The aim of this project is to finished a project with a startup in Switzerland in order to increase their market stickiness. Our partnered company is Vereign, a startup that aims to provide decentralized digital identities. Right now their are many providing authenticated email and e-signing services for other corporates.

The whole process was a great learning process: 1) during the class, we always had inputs from experts from both the startup side or the investor side. From startup sides, we can always learn from their stories or experiences that may help us in the future entrepreneurship process. From the investor sides, we are able to know their considerations of whether to invest a startup or not.

Besides, we were also able to work closely with the startup Vereign. We had great talks with the CEO and CTO of the startup. We learned a lot from the digital identity field and what's their big vision of the future. We also questioned a lot of their work as well, which, hopefully, helped them. In the end, we did a small project about the characterization of the authentication of the digital identities and we compared Vereign and other companies that provides similar (but different) services. The results were presented at the last lecture.
