The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm enables parameter estimation in probabilistic models with incomplete data set. It deals with missing data. Or more specifically the EM algorithm is a general method to find MLE of the parameter of a distribution from a given data which is incomplete or has missing values. 

EM can be seen as iteratively maximizing a lower bound on the log-likelihood. The below equation partially explains the reason for this.
