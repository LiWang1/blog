Hi, nice to see you here, I am a master of ETH Zurich. Now I major in environmental engineering and I am interested in data science. I write this blog to share the things that I have learnt and keep track of them. If you find any mistakes or anything else that you find interesting from me, feel free to contact me at: wangli@student.ethz.ch
