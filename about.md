### Education:
* [MSc in Environmental Engineering, ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/)
* [BSc in Water Supply and Drainage Engineering, Hunan University](http://www-en.hnu.edu.cn/)

### Experience:
* __[Automatic Differentiation for Environmental Models](https://github.com/LiWang1/masterthesis)__, Eawag (ETH Zurich), 2019~2020    
*Master Thesis (Supervised by: Andreas Scheidegger and Prof. Max Maurer)*
  * Assessed the potential of AD for speeding up the environmental model calibration processes;
  * Extended the traditional environmental models (ODEs) with neural networks and increased the model prediction performance;
  * [Results see the report;](https://www.overleaf.com/read/rztwzbrsmtwm)

* __[Carsharing demand estimation and supply optimization for California](https://github.com/LiWang1/hiwi_ivt)__, Institute for Traffic Planning and Transport Systems (ETH Zurich), 2019  
*Research Assistant (Supervised by: Dr. Balac Milos)*
  * Transportation data analysis with R and Python, data interpretation and visulization;
  * Modelcalibration (MATsim);

* __Water Discharge Estimation using SSIV and Machine Learning Methods__ , Photrack AG, 2019  
*Master Project (Supervised by: Dr. Joao Paublo and Prof. Max Maurer)*
  * Collected data and assessed the performance of the product "Discharge-Keeper" in the sewer system;
  * Adjusted the algorithm and removed the effect of extreme weathers (fog) influence;
  * The results have been published at [AquaUrbanica](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/M_Burkhardt/publication/337772421_Regenwasser_weiterdenken_-_Bemessen_trifft_Gestalten_-_Tagungsband_der_Aqua_Urbanica_2019/links/5de95d164585159aa4658dc0/Regenwasser-weiterdenken-Bemessen-trifft-Gestalten-Tagungsband-der-Aqua-Urbanica-2019.pdf#page=41);
